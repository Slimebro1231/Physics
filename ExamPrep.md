# Exams!

So. All the units... Here is a general checklist:
**Also some important things:**
- The exam is going to be consisted primarily of dynamics
  This places priority on forces and energy.
* [ ] Dynamics
  * [ ] Kinematics
    * [ ] Projectile motion
    * [ ] Relative velocity
  * [ ] Forces
    * [ ] Slope - spring questions
    * [ ] Centripetal force
  * [ ] Energy
    * [ ] Energy approach to dynamics questions
    * [ ] Work & Conservation of energy
    * [ ] Potential energy; Gravity and Springs
    * [ ] Kinetic energy
    * [ ] Energy graphs
  * [ ] Momentum
    * [ ] Elastic collisions
    * [ ] Inelastic collisions
    * [ ] Collisions and energy
    * [ ] Relativistic momentum
* [ ] Other stuff
  * [ ] Electrostatic fields
  * [ ] Gravitational fields
  * [ ] Magnetic fields
  * [ ] Waves
  * [ ] Quantum


**Super important things to remember!**
Nearly everything in physics is symmetrical, including time, collisions and a lot of other things. 


### Critical Equations (and explanations)

---

## More detailed Exam Prep:
So we start with dynamics, which make up most of the exam.
The following topics will include: General Outline, Important Ideas, Explanation, Common questions, Common Misconceptions, and Important Equations.

### Kinematics

Starting with Kinematics, this is the basics of the dynamics unit, and being bad at kinematics will be absolutely devastating for the following units. The good news is that the concepts are quite simple, and if you have made this far, chances are you will find this simple.
