# Exams!

So. All the units... Here is a general checklist:
**Also some important things:**
- The exam is going to be consisted primarily of dynamics
  This places priority on forces and energy.
* [ ] Dynamics
  * [ ] Kinematics
    * [ ] Projectile motion
    * [ ] Relative velocity
  * [ ] Forces
    * [ ] Slope - spring questions
    * [ ] Centripetal force
  * [ ] Energy
    * [ ] Energy approach to dynamics questions
    * [ ] Work & Conservation of energy
    * [ ] Potential energy; Gravity and Springs
    * [ ] Kinetic energy
    * [ ] Energy graphs
  * [ ] Momentum
    * [ ] Elastic collisions
    * [ ] Inelastic collisions
    * [ ] Collisions and energy
    * [ ] Relativistic momentum
* [ ] Other stuff
  * [ ] Electrostatic fields
  * [ ] Gravitational fields
  * [ ] Magnetic fields
  * [ ] Waves
  * [ ] Quantum


**Super important things to remember!**
Nearly everything in physics is symmetrical, including time, collisions and a lot of other things.
