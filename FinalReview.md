# Final version of Notes

So it has come to the point where there is 2 days left till the exam, so really there is no time to make a tutorial on everything. So instead, here is a list/document with all of the **important** information to remember, such as graphing tricks. 

As a list of things to be considerate of:

Kinematics
-
> Kinematics is mostly just about using the big-5 formulas and understanding vector components. 

All questions revolved around pure kinematics are based off of simple vector manipulation, which is very limited. However, the ideas carry on as the course progresses. 

This means that projectile motion can involve forces, which can involve fields, and vector addition can involve energy and momentum. 

Here are the big five formulas:
