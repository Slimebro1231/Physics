# Final version of Notes

So it has come to the point where there is 2 days left till the exam, so really there is no time to make a tutorial on everything. So instead, here is a list/document with all of the **important** information to remember, such as graphing tricks. 

As a list of things to be considerate of:

Kinematics
-
> Kinematics is mostly just about using the big-5 formulas and understanding vector components. 

All questions revolved around pure kinematics are based off of simple vector manipulation, which is very limited. However, the ideas carry on as the course progresses. 

This means that projectile motion can involve forces, which can involve fields, and vector addition can involve energy and momentum. 

Here are the big five formulas:


| Formula                              | Missing Variable |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| $\Delta{x} = x - x_0 = \bar{v}t$     | $a$              |
| $v = v_0 + at$                        | $\Delta{x}$      |
| $x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$   | $v$              |
| $x = x_0 + vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2$     | $v_0$            |
| $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)$          | $t$              |

Something also really important here is reading graphs. This would be a quite important concept to use in momentum, as collision graphs are symmetrical. Essentially the concept is that we have a hiearchy that goes like:

Acceleration -> Velocity -> Displacement

And left to right is area, right to left is derivative. This means the acceleration is the rate of change in velocity, and the velocity is the area underneath the acceleration time graph. 

Forces
-

Forces is also another part of physics that is really the fundamentals. ( Three fundamentals I believe are Kinematics, Forces, and Energy)

The only thing to really understand here is that Fnet = ma, and to really remember that Fnet includes angles and relative motion.

This may sound interesting, that there is relative motion in forces, but it is true. 

For any object that is connected through a rope, it essentially merges the objects together.
