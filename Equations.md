# Equation Sheet

I know there is an equation sheet provided for the exam, but we don't know what is **exactly** on it, so we will create our own, and have an explanation of each equation and when to use it. 

Of course, we start with kinematics.

Kinematics
-

We have the Big 5 first, which is really just **3 equations**. 

There is the universal one, of:

$$displacement=\bar{v}t$$

Displacement is equivalent to velocity multiplied with time, when you have the average velocity of the trip, or it is a constant velocity; usually seen in the x component of projectile motion questions.

$$d=v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$

This has to do with graphing/integrals, but essentially, this is finding the **area under the graph**, as we know that the area under a vt graph is the displacement. 

Usually we have the velocity, displacement and acceleration, and we are trying to find the time. We will then rearrange this equation and use the quadratic formula. However, I am not a big fan of the quadratic formula, and instead I use the following:

$$v_f^2=v_0^2+2ad$$

I use this equation together with the equation of:

$$v_f = v_0 +at$$

which is really convinient, and you won't get two answers. However, use it to your liking. 

Forces
-

Moving on to forces, where there are a lot more equations to cover.

Of course, the most important equation is $F_{net} = ma$. You should know this by now, or you will be in a lot of trouble.
Everything else is essentially just utilizing this formula. 

Something very important is action reaction forces, where there is a normal force perpendicular to the surface in contact. This could mean things are at an angle! where we would then have to adjust our coordinate system accordingly.

Energy
-
Energy is also a really important fundamental part of physics. The good part is that there isn't that much to remember about energy. 

The majority of energy is revolved around the transfer between potential energy and kinetic energy ( and perhaps loss to other factors).

Usually it is a simple transformation between something like spring potential energy and kinetic energy. In this transition, usually there is energy loss due to friction. 

For the purposes of this exam, there is a lot of friction, which means that friction energy loss will be in nearly every single question. 

So friction is calculated as "work", as friction is lost as internal energy, which is really hard to calculate. So for calculation, we use the "equation" of:
$$Work = Force * Displacement$$
