#### Important Equations

**Basic wave equation:** 
$a \, sin (\omega t - kx + \phi)$

**Wave number, $k$:**
$k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$

**Wavelength:**
$v = f\lambda$

**Angular frequency (_super important_):**
$T = period$

$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f$

**Snell's Law**
$n_1 =$ incident index (from the normal)
$n_2 =$ refracted index (from the normal)
$$\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{sin \theta_1}{sin \theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$$
**Path differences**

# Expansion into Major topics
Explanation for all major topics
### Properties of Waves and Light

**Travelling waves** and its properties first.
&emsp; A travelling wave is obviously a wave travelling. Some things to remember about this is that if we want something to move in the $+x$ direction, we can simply replace the $x$ with a $ x-vt $. 


**Standing waves** are not **that** different, except for one important thing. This is that the **nodes** on a standing wave are... well standing. They don't move, unlike in a travelling wave, where the wave amp doesn't fluctuate, it is the entire wave travelling.

This is better explained in an example. 

### Interference of waves
To be fair this is really quite hard to understand, but I will try my best.
Something basic to start with is constructive and destructive interference.$$



In the double slit interference experiment, where young proved that light is a wave, we can get the **path length difference formula**. Further expansion on this...


### Properties of Diffraction
Also difficult to understand, but uses the same formula as double slit interference.
