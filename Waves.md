#### Important Equations

**Basic wave equation:** 
$a \, sin (\omega t - kx + \phi)$

**Wave number, $k$:**
$k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$

**Wavelength:**
$v = f\lambda$

**Angular frequency (_super important_):**
$T = period$

$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}=2\pi f$

**Snell's Law**
$n_1 =$ incident index (from the normal)
$n_2 =$ refracted index (from the normal)
$$\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{sin \theta_1}{sin \theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}$$
**Path differences**

# Expansion into Major topics

## Major assumptions
Quite important to think about, so you don't **lose your mind** when you hear $sin(\theta) = \theta$ in approximation.

Explanation for all major topics
### Properties of Waves and Light

**Travelling waves** and its properties first.
&emsp; A travelling wave is obviously a wave travelling. Some things to remember about this is that if we want something to move in the $+x$ direction, we can simply replace the $x$ with a $ x-vt $. 


**Standing waves** are not **that** different, except for one important thing. This is that the **nodes** on a standing wave are... well standing. They don't move, unlike in a travelling wave, where the wave amp doesn't fluctuate, it is the entire wave travelling.


#### Section summary:
Travelling waves have non-stationary nodes, and "shift". Standing waves oscilate around the nodes, thus at 1/4 of a period it will be a straight line.

**Uniform formula:**

$$y = a sin (kx - \omega t)$$

### Refraction and total internal reflection

Starting with **Huygen's Principle**. This is essentially a theoretical concept to help visualize waves travelling around objects. You will often see reference to something called a "Huygen source". This is a source where spherical waves propagate from.

![S1 and S2 are both Huygen sources](Images/doubleSlit.png)

*S1 and S2 are both Huygen sources*
This is less important than the ray & wave model that we use for reflection and refraction.

> In terms of reflection and refraction, when light reflects off a **denser** surface, the phase **Flips**; when the light passes through the surface, the phase **stays the same**; when the light reflects off a less dense surface, the phase **stays the same**;
> When n<sub>2</sub> is denser than n<sub>1</sub>, phase of AD **flips**; When n<sub>3</sub> is less dense than n<sub>2</sub>, phase of AD **remains the same**; vice versa.
> Rays that **pass through**, such as AD, **do not change phase**



### Interference of waves
To be fair this is really quite hard to understand, but I will try my best.
Something basic to start with is constructive and destructive interference.
> **Concept to remember:** 
> If two waves hit the source at the same phase, they form a higher bump, if they are 180deg out of phase, they kill each other, forming darkness.
> **Interference** is how you get light+light equals darkness


In the double slit interference experiment, we can get the **path length difference formula**. Something super important is the small angle approximation.
Further expansion on this...


### Properties of Diffraction
Also difficult to understand, but uses the same formula as double slit interference.
