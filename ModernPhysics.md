# The special theory of relativity

## Modern Physics

---

Super hard unit to think about, but there are no calculations that we need! Which is a good thing to be fair. There is going to be **8-10 questions multiple choice** on the test, which are all conceptual, that we are going to predict.

# An expansion into the topics:

## Newtonian Relativity
Relatively simple topic. So recalling from kinematics and stuff, when there is frame of reference being used, shit just... works.
This means all the principle laws of physics are still laws, and nothing breaks **quite yet**. 
So as an example, if I had two balls colliding on a track on my desk, I would observe the same results if I brought the track onto a train. 

So this is classical mechanics, where we aren't trying to move things at **very** fast speeds. In the case where we don't try to move so fast we break things, **space and time** is absolute everywhere.

This means that 1 second on a car is 1 second anywhere and everywhere, and 1 meter on a track is 1 meter anywhere and everywhere. After all, its a *unit of measurement*. Better be accurate. 

## Special Relativity Postulates

#### Principle of Relativity

#### Speed of light principle

## Simultaneity

## Time Dilation

## Length Contraction in fast objects

## Relativistic speeds and velocity

## Mass and Energy of Light

## 4D Space and Time Warp of mass and speed

# Test Predictions

Here is stuff that potentially could be on the test:

1. Shining a light on a fast moving bus
2. Twin experiment
