# The special theory of relativity

## Modern Physics

---

Super hard unit to think about, but there are no calculations that we need! Which is a good thing to be fair. There is going to be **8-10 questions multiple choice** on the test, all of which are all conceptual, that we are going to predict.

# An expansion into the topics:

## Newtonian Relativity
Relatively simple topic. So recalling from kinematics and stuff, when there is frame of reference being used, shit just... works.
This means all the principle laws of physics are still laws, and nothing breaks **quite yet**. 
So as an example, if I had two balls colliding on a track on my desk, I would observe the same results if I brought the track onto a train. 

So this is classical mechanics, where we aren't trying to move things at **very** fast speeds. In the case where we don't try to move so fast we break things, **space and time** is absolute everywhere.

This means that 1 second on a car is 1 second anywhere and everywhere, and 1 meter on a track is 1 meter anywhere and everywhere. After all, its a *unit of measurement*. Better be accurate. 

## Special Relativity Postulates

Some concepts/theories/assumptions of physics

#### Principle of Relativity

So this is what we covered in Newtonian relativity, where the laws of physics are still laws no matter what inertial frame of reference is picked. 

> :bulb: Also you can never tell if you are at rest or moving at constant velocity
> **As an example:** If you are on a train, and you look at another train moving backwards, it is hard to tell which train is moving.

#### Speed of light principle

This is a fascinating topic to cover. To sum it up in short, no matter at what reference frame you choose to pick, the speed of light relative to you is always the speed of light. Sounds confusing?

So if I am on a train and I throw a ball in the direction the train is travelling, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is [trainSpeed] + [ballSpeed] and the speed of the ball relative to the train is just [ballSpeed]. **However**, replacing the ball with a flashlight gives interesting results. To you, on the train, the speed of light is c, but to someone looking at the light on the ground, the speed of light is *also* c. 

How can this be? Well, this has to do with weird light-speed travel funkiness of space and time, and will be better understood as we cover time dilation, and the warp of time and space due to mass and speed.


## Simultaneity

This essentially includes that "simultaneous" behavior is a bit of an arbitrary concept, as information takes time to travel. and what is time anyways? Since it isn't a constant.

## Time Dilation

## Length Contraction in fast objects

## Relativistic speeds and velocity

## Mass and Energy of Light

## 4D Space and Time Warp of mass and speed

# Test Predictions

Here is stuff that potentially could be on the test:

1. Shining a light on a fast moving bus
2. Twin experiment
